Query 4: 普段、日本語のクラスで英語を話してもいいですか。
Response: はい、普段、日本語のクラスで英語を話してもいいです。ただし、英語の会話は日本語のクラスの内容と合わせて行うことをおすすめします。英語の会話は、日本語の会話と合わせて学ぶことで、より深く理解することが可能になります。

This response is more characteristic of an intermediate level rather than a novice, which typically involves simpler sentence structures and vocabulary.
